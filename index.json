Despite their success in encoding large problems with a compact set of weighted rules, performing inference over these models is often challenging. In this paper, we show how to effectively combine two powerful ideas for scaling inference for large graphical models. The first idea, lifted inference, is a wellstudied approach to speeding up inference in graphical models by exploiting symmetries in the underlying problem. The second idea is to frame Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference as a convex optimization problem and use alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem in parallel. A well-studied relaxation to the combinatorial optimization problem defined for logical Markov random fields gives rise to a hinge-loss Markov random field (HLMRF) for which MAP inference is a convex optimization problem. We show how the formalism introduced for coloring weighted bipartite graphs using a color refinement algorithm can be integrated with the ADMM optimization technique to take advantage of the sparse dependency structures of HL-MRFs. Our proposed approach, lifted hinge-loss Markov random fields (LHL-MRFs), preserves the structure of the original problem after lifting and solves lifted inference as distributed convex optimization with ADMM. In our empirical evaluation on real-world problems, we observe up to a three times speed up in inference over HL-MRFs.","tags":null,"title":"Lifted Hinge-Loss Markov Random Fields","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Golnoosh Farnadi$^*$","**Behrouz Babaki$^*$**","Lise Getoor"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517529600,"objectID":"d8401a4947184b9891ec4be800e7fcfb","permalink":"https://Behrouz-Babaki.github.io/publication/aies18/","publishdate":"2018-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aies18/","section":"publication","summary":"AI and machine learning tools are being used with increasing frequency for decision making in domains that affect peoples' lives such as employment, education, policing and loan approval. These uses raise concerns about biases of algorithmic discrimination and have motivated the development of fairness-aware machine learning. However, existing fairness approaches are based solely on attributes of individuals. In many cases, discrimination is much more complex, and taking into account the social, organizational, and other connections between individuals is important. We introduce new notions of fairness that are able to capture the relational structure in a domain. We use first-order logic to provide a flexible and expressive language for specifying complex relational patterns of discrimination. Furthermore, we extend an existing statistical relational learning framework, probabilistic soft logic (PSL), to incorporate our definition of relational fairness. We refer to this fairness-aware framework FairPSL. FairPSL makes use of the logical definitions of fairnesss but also supports a probabilistic interpretation. In particular, we show how to perform maximum a posteriori(MAP) inference by exploiting probabilistic dependencies within the domain while avoiding violation of fairness guarantees. Preliminary empirical evaluation shows that we are able to make both accurate and fair decisions.","tags":null,"title":"Fairness in Relational Domains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Behrouz Babaki**","Dries Van Daele","Bram Weytjens","Tias Guns"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1508371200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508371200,"objectID":"7ea2f5ffd260ca27f56552cf06c683d0","permalink":"https://Behrouz-Babaki.github.io/publication/dsmo17/","publishdate":"2017-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dsmo17/","section":"publication","summary":"Clustering is a well-defined problem class in data mining, and many variations of it exists. However, practitioners often have additional constraints or quality scores that are not supported by standard algorithms. This has lead to the study of constrained clustering, which investigates generic methods to handle a variety of constraints and objectives. In our bioinformatics work, we were faced with exactly such a problem: a graph clustering problem with strict connectivity requirements and an objective function based on penalties rather than density of the clustering. In this paper, we explain the problem including the constraints and quality measures, and propose to use generic Mixed Integer Programming to solve it. We propose two approaches to handle the connectivity requirement in particular: one defined over all simple paths in the graph explicitly, and one based on cutting planes that enforce connectivity only when needed. Our experiments show that these approaches are able to solve the problem well. We hence demonstrate the applicability of generic OR methods on this application-driven data mining problem.","tags":null,"title":"A Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for Constrained Graph Clustering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nguyen Van Son","**Behrouz Babaki**","Anton Dries","Pham Quang Dung","Nguyen Xuan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1508371200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508371200,"objectID":"1f6898c981ea32ea571205d5f1220a05","permalink":"https://Behrouz-Babaki.github.io/publication/kse17/","publishdate":"2017-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kse17/","section":"publication","summary":"One of the major problems faced in the urban environment is the efficient public transportation of people and goods.

We argue that these problems can be modeled in a new language, SC-ProbLog, that combines a generic Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) language, ProbLog, with stochastic constraint optimization. We propose a toolchain for effectively solving these SC-ProbLog programs, which consists of two stages. In the first stage, decision diagrams are compiled for the underlying distributions. These diagrams are converted into models that are solved using Mixed Integer Programming or Constraint Programming solvers in the second stage. We show that, to yield linear constraints, decision diagrams need to be compiled in a specific form. We introduce a new method for compiling small Sentential Decision Diagrams in this form. We evaluate the effectiveness of several variations of this toolchain on test cases in viral marketing and bioinformatics.","tags":null,"title":"Combining Stochastic Constraint Optimization and Probabilistic Programming - From Knowledge Compilation to Constraint Solving","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Behrouz Babaki**","Tias Guns","Luc De Raedt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1503100800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503100800,"objectID":"fd1eb726d56b2b4c911becde3f5d695e","permalink":"https://Behrouz-Babaki.github.io/publication/ijcai17/","publishdate":"2017-08-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ijcai17/","section":"publication","summary":"Complex multi-stage decision making problems often involve uncertainty, for example, regarding demand or processing times.

We show how a state-of-the-art probabilistic inference engine can be integrated into standard constraint solvers.

Tools to assist users in the analysis of Bayesian networks can help. In this paper, we introduce a novel general framework and tool for answering exploratory queries over Bayesian networks. The framework is inspired by queries from the constraint-based mining literature designed for the exploratory analysis of data. Adapted to Bayesian networks, these queries specify a set of constraints on explanations of interest, where an explanation is an assignment to a subset of variables in a network. Characteristic for the methodology is that it searches over different subsets of the explanations, corresponding to different marginalizations. A general purpose framework, based on principles of constraint programming, data mining and knowledge compilation, is used to answer all possible queries. This CP4BN framework employs a rich set of constraints and is able to emulate a range of existing queries from both the Bayesian network and the constraint-based data mining literature.","tags":null,"title":"Constraint-Based Querying for Bayesian Network Exploration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Behrouz Babaki**","Tias Guns","Siegfried Nijssen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1400457600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1400457600,"objectID":"a17c7e88b31480341f32dd2a92caa448","permalink":"https://Behrouz-Babaki.github.io/publication/cccg/","publishdate":"2014-05-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cccg/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, it has been realized that many problems in data mining can be seen as pure optimisation problems. In this work, we investigate the problem of constraint-based clustering from an optimisation point of view. The use of constraints in clustering is a recent development and allows to encode prior beliefs about desirable clusters. This paper proposes a new solution for minimum-sum-of-squares clustering under constraints, where the constraints considered are must-link constraints, cannot-link constraints and anti-monotone constraints on individual clusters. Contrary to most earlier approaches, it is exact and provides a fundamental approach for including these constraints. The proposed approach uses column generation in an integer linear programming setting. The key insight is that these constraints can be pushed into a branch-and-bound algorithm used for generating new columns. Experimental results show the feasibility of the approach and the promise of the branch-and-bound algorithm that solves the subproblem directly.","tags":null,"title":"Constrained Clustering Using Column Generation","type":"publication"}]
